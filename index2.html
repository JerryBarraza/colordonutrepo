		<div>
			<p>
				Copied the code for the snake game because I would not have known how to do this. But it's okay
				becuase we're all learning and I give credit to original author in the code. I just messed
				around with the styling and and put buttons to play on mobile. Still need to figure out swipe
				gestures on mobile browser.

				Why? - I don't think I'll keep this blog. I'm not good at
				writting or expressing/having ideas.

				I copied Lisa from an image I saw online,
				the clouds are from the opening of The Simpsons.
				I just thought it looked cool.

				Colorful Donut: if you look at the code, I basically
				stole it and just modified it a little to show color changes
				and some other effects. So the math part isn't mine, but the color
				shift was easy to do. I'm not too good at this coding stuff.
